## The Start of the Blog

I decided to create a blog using github to keep track of myself and my progress through my current masters. I am currently a graduate student at the University of Virginia. With this blog I intend to make a lot of chatter about software development, physics, education, gaming, and more. It will be an adventure.

This blog is being made with github Jekyll which is a plugin that converts [markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) files into html to be able to view. 

 ```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
