## Start of a new semester!
Today I started my next semester at UVA, and hopefully my last or second to last as I prepare my master thesis. <br>
<br>
  **The Goal**<br>
The goal behind my thesis is to devolpe an adaptive fitting aproach for partical reconstruction that will ultilize the GPU. 
In nuclear physics most of the data is from partical collisons that, with the use of software, we can reconstruct the "tracks" of the particals detected after collison back to the original event. 
With these reconstructions we can glean information on the physics of what is happening in hopes to find something new. 
<br>
<br>
  **Purpose**<br>
In these large scale experiments the amount of data collected, events, is an unbelievable amount. To process all of this information and do the reconstruction takes hours and it will be my goal to minimize this time.
Using computational techniques I strive to improve the effiency of the software by a order of 10. 
<br>
<br>
  **Plan** <br>
During this semester I will preform a lot of tasks to aid in this venture. I will create Monte Carlo simulations, structures in Geant4, and gain skills in machine learning. I hope to bring you along with me and I will post
everything that I learn.
